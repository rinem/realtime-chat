# Real Time Chat
A real time chat web application using WebSockets and NodeJS that sends and receives messages in real time.
Also used the broadcast feature to inform users when someone is typing.
I have deployed the app on heroku and it can be viewed and used here : https://webchat101.herokuapp.com
